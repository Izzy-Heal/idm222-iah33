<p class="aboutP">
    I am a 20-year-old  Interactive Digital Media major at Drexel University. I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I have always had a passion for art and design. 
    My mother would take me to the Philadelphia Museum of art often and I would always marvel at the things people could create. I spent my first year and a quarter at Drexel studying Computer Science. 
    I realized in the fall of my sophomore year that Computer Science was not a major that I could create and be creative in the same way that I have always been interested in and enjoyed doing. 
    One of my main goals for my work is to create things that are unique and beautiful. 
    I am deeply interested in aethetics and functionality for every type of user. As a queer person I like for that part of who i am to shine in my work. 
    I believe that recognizing the impacts that queerness brings to aethetic work is very important for what I create.
